Answers:
1) Have you worked on Docker? How would you rate yourself in Docker out of 5?
Yes, I have worked extensively on Docker. I would rate myself 4.5 out of 5 because I have a strong understanding of containerization, Docker commands, and Dockerfile usage, and Iâ€™ve built and managed multiple containerized applications in production environments.

2} What are the different instructions in a Dockerfile?
The common instructions in a Dockerfile include:

FROM: Specifies the base image.
RUN: Executes commands to install software or perform tasks.
CMD: Provides the default command to run a container.
ENTRYPOINT: Similar to CMD, but more static and allows arguments to be passed.
COPY: Copies files from the local machine to the container.
ADD: Similar to COPY but can also fetch URLs and extract tar files.
WORKDIR: Sets the working directory in the container.
EXPOSE: Specifies the port on which the container will listen.
ENV: Sets environment variables.
Can you explain all these instructions?
(Provide brief descriptions as above and include examples, if needed.)

3) What is the build command used to build a Docker image?
The command is: docker build -t <image_name>:<tag> .

4) What is the command to check Docker resource usage?
The command is: docker stats.

5) How can you check the logs of a container?
You can use the command: docker logs <container_id>.

6) How can you attach a port to a Docker container?
You can map ports using the -p flag while running a container, e.g., docker run -p 8080:80 <image>.

7) Do you know the range of NodePort?
Yes, the default NodePort range in Kubernetes is 30000-32767.
